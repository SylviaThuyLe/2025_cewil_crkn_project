## 1. [Register for a GitHub account](https://github.com/)

I recommend that you incorporate your name in your username so that
collaborators can identify you. Use lowercase letters and dashes to
prevent coding challenges. Do not include your current university or
employer, since those will change over your career.

example: My username is estregger, but other good options would be
emstregger or elizabeth-stregger.

## 2. Install Git

### 2.1 Windows: Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

This version, from gitforwindows.org, is also known as “Git Bash.”
Modify one of the default installation prompts: select “Git from the
command line and also 3rd-party software.”

### 2.2 MacOS

There are a few good options for installing Git on a Mac. Choose the one
that matches the way you use your computer.

#### 2.2.1 Install Git from Terminal

Open Terminal from the Utilities section of your Applications.

``` default
# Type this in the Terminal window. If copying and pasting, do it one line at a time.
git --version
git config

# Accept the offer to install Xcode command line tools. This will take approximately 10 minutes, depending on your Internet connection.
```

#### 2.2.2 Install Git using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

If you’ve already worked with lots of scientific computing packages, you
might be used to installing using homebrew in the Terminal. You could
also set up Homebrew as part of this workshop!

Open Terminal from the Utilities section of your Applications.

``` default
brew install git
```

Then restart your terminal.

## 3. Install [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop)
